At first, I wasn't a zts believer. I first found him through Compllege's Phant III. I enjoyed Taishis and Nhatos entries, but Zts horizon effect didn't have the same effect on me. I didn't try to discover zts works for another 2 years. 

Then I found Taishi's [*goldenslaughterer*](https://youtu.be/iyPsn4fK5kc)  remix and found it amazing. I googled through the album it came from, and low and behold it was from ztss winter label. I thought, "huh that shit head, wonder why taishi collaborated with him." little did I know that zts was a legendary artist


What truly got me into ZTS was this Umineko[^1]Compliation, mixed by La Cataline

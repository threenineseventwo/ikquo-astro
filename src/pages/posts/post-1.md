## Preface

One day, youtube randomly recommended me *Dear Eternity*, the 2nd track of Phant III, composed by Nhato. I had never heard of Nhato, before, or any of the other artists on the album, such as Taishi and Zts. Still, I clicked on the video, partly from curiosity of what could this be, but also because the thumbnail looked intriging. However, what I wouldn't know is the rabbit hole I was about to fall into for the next 5 years, and the discovery of some of my favorite artists.

*Note: I'm going to go in the order of what songs I listened to first, rather than the order of the track list*
## Dear Eternity


## Unterhimmel
This actually wasn't the first time I had heard of Taishi. I previously stubbled upon his work *The Shadows* in **AD Piano: Noir**, but didn't make the connection that it was him composing Unterhimmel too.

## Horizon Effect
I only listened to this song a few years after I had discovered the previous two, as I didn't realize they were apart of the same album. However, I did not miss out on much, as Zts' Horizon Effect was the weakest link of the album. With Dear Eternity and Unterhimmel, they start out slow, and over time add up effects, and ending with a beautiful slam. Horizon Effect sort of begins as a techno beat, and stays that way the entire time.
